# DB-car_showroom
Development and design of a database of cars showroom.

This repository contains the required minimum number of SQL queries for database development. The relational DBMS Microsoft SQL Server v.18 is used. The software was developed using Embarcadero Studio Delphi v10.4.

An external user interface was developed in the Delphi cross-platform programming language, which allows both an ordinary user who does not have knowledge of programming and SQL language, and an experienced user to work with this database. The interface provides easy switching between queries and filters, which are defined by stored procedures. There are also table updates, adding or deleting records.

Other versions are not supported.
